############# HOW-TO: ENT_STANDALONE (NON-GLOBAL) RUN ########
HOW-TO set up a run in Ent_standalone mode (single column Ent without land surface hydrology).
First see the HOW-TO in the Workspace/HOW-TO.
#1 - Specify in your .modelErc the path for ENT_DATADIR for driver files.
     You can also specify this path in the r_ent_fbb.mk makefile to override .modelErc.
#2 - Specify in your .modelErc the path for GCMSEARCHPATH.  
     On athena, this would be /u/cmrun.  
     You can also specify this path in the r_ent_fbb.mk makefile to override .modelErc.
#3 - In Workspace/r_ent_fbb.mk rundeck, specify different options (OPTS_Ent)   
     For single-grid cell runs, you should add values for I0f,I1f,J0f,and J1f to specify single-grid forcings.
     OPTS_Ent:
       PS_MODEL=FBB            Default: FBB, for Farquhar/Ball-Berry;  other option is FK for Friend&Kiang.
       PFT_MODEL=ENT           Default: GISS for Matthews 8 veg types; other for 16 PFTS
       ENT_STANDALONE_DIAG=YES Default: NO.  Add if you want to output all the fort.995 diagnostics (you probably do).
       FLUXNET=YES             Default: NO.  Add to compile ent_pfts_FLUXNET.f and FBBpfts_FLUXNET.f for
				site-based vegetation parameters. 
       MIXED_CANOPY_OPT=YES    Default: NO.  Add to OPTS_Ent and OPTS_Ent_standalone to read in and generate
                                mixed-canopy vegetation structure.  Not set up for global scale, yet.
                                NOTE:  Data structure must be described in a csv file;  for syntax rules, see
                                Ent/ent_make_struct.f routine ent_struct_readcsv.  LAIMIXED and HEIGHTMIXED files 
                                must consist of single files each, with cohort values in columns in order of
                                oldest to youngest patch, tallest to shortest cohort.
#4   In Workspace/r_ent_fbb.mk, link to off-line driver files.
             -Specify the names of all your driver files.
	     -For the soil carbon initialization files, use "#" to comment out the line specifying SOILCARB_global.  
               MOVE THIS LINE to the section where OPTS_ is specified, because the INPUT_FILES section has trouble 
               skipping commented out lines.
             -In the INPUT_FILES section, below the line for soil_textures, insert a line:
		SOILCARB_site=$(ENT_DATADIR)/SOILCARB_site.csv \
#5 - In src/Ent_standalone/Makefile, at the bottom of the Makefile, there are
     optional CPPFLAGS to add:
     SOILCARB_SITE:  add if you have your own site-based soil carbon values in your own file.
     FLUXNETINIT:    add if you want to initialize vegetation structure with different values from
                     the Matthews dataset (in src/Ent/ent_GISSveg.f and src/Ent/Ent_ENTveg.f,
                     you can alter the alamin and alamax arrays).  These values are for the cases
                     when you want to simulate prescribed LAI as seasonal sinusoids (original GISS
                     algorithms), or if you want to make sure the initial carbon reserve pool in your
                     vegetation is consistent with the LAI measurements that you will be prescribing.

     *The Ent_standalone/Makefile CPPFLAGS for some reason don't get seen, so it looks like these flags
      will have to be specified in the rundeck and src/Ent/Makefile.

#6 - Specify RUN_PARAMETERS.  Replace the following values as relevant to your run.
     See Workspace/HOW-TO for additional parameters.
       RUN_PARAMETERS = \
       &input_parameters \
       year = 1998,jday=1, jday2=10, \
       IM=72, JM=46, I0=40, I1=40, J0=39, J1=39, \
       force_VEG=false, do_soilinit=true \

#Resolution: (IM,JM only 72x46 currently supported)
#Size of driver files: (I0f,I1f,J0f,J1f, default 72x46 layers, can also be single column)
#Grid cell within a 72x46 grid to extract (I0,I1,J0,J1) if doing a single-column run.

############### COMPILE AND RUN ########################
#To compile:
gmake clean
gmake setup RUN=r_ent_fbb [The name of your .mk file without .mk at the end]

#TEMPORARY:To allow for prescribing soil C_org pools from an external file for a single site:
#gmake setup RUN=[your .mk file prefix]  EXTRA_FFLAGS=-DSOILCARB_SITE
#Some compilers may need extra flags, e.g. for Absoft:
# make setup RUN=r_ent_fbb CPPFLAGS="-DMACHINE_MAC -DCOMPILER_ABSOFT -DSOILCARB_SITE"
#See notes for ent_input.
#...for 2-layer mode use: 
#gmake setup RUN=r_ent_fbb EXTRA_FFLAGS=-DNCASA2 

# The file ent_input is now generated automatically according to the .mk file.
# Default settings are:
# &input_parameters
# year = 1998,jday=1, jday2=10,year2=1998,IM=72, JM=46, I0=40, I1=40,J0=39,J1=39
# force_VEG=false, do_soilinit=true, do_soilresp=true, do_phenology=false
#, do_patchdynamics=false, do_spinup=false, do_frost_hardiness=true
# /
# These values are NOT generated automatically (yet): I0f1,I1f,J0f,J1f 

# A subdirectory is created with the ent_input file and the executable.
# The subdirectory and executable have the same name as your .mk file (without .mk).

#To run:
#cd r_ent_fbb (subdirectory generated during compile)
#./r_ent_fbb  (executable)
