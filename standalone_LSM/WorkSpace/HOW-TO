HOW-TO compile Ent for various configurations:

1. Modify the sample rundeck r_ent_fbb.mk.
   See options in rundeck for OPTS_ENT for photosynthesis module, PFT types, parameter sets.

2. For Ent_standalone run (site drivers), see HOW-TO in src/Ent_standalone/HOW-TO.

3. For a single site at the ecosystem-scale using giss_LSM_standalone 
   (site meteorological drivers with GISS LSM and the Ent DGTEM)
   In order to run the model for a single site, you do the following:
a) Uncomment "#define ECOSYSTEM_SCALE" in drv_gswp_force.f, lsm_standalone.f,
   and GHY.f
b) Change directory in .modelErc for site parameters (depends on you settings
   in the run_name.mk file)
c) Adjust run_name.mk file to read in correct site parameters
d) gmake setup RUN=run_name
e) You need to decide which files you will use for the following
   variables/parameters (listed in the makefile):
   SOIL - global, constant in time
   TOP_INDEX - global, constant in time
   VEG - global, constant in time
   CROPS -global, constant in time
   soil_textures - global, constant in time
   SOILCARB_global - global, constant in time
   CD_coef - global, constant in time
   fluxnet_LAI - for each pft, for every timestep
   fluxnet_vheight - for each pft, constant in time
   site_forcings (meteorological drivers -see format in drv_gswp_force.f) -
      for single cell, for every timestep
   If a variable/parameter listed above is 'global' and you have site-specific
   data, then you need to create a global array with you data properly located
   in teh array.  For CD_coef, you might have site specific data realted to
   sensor height, displacement height, etc.  You will need to modify these
   values directly in drv_gswp_force.f.

   Note:  The files fort.951, fort.952, fort.953 are dumps of a GCM run to
   provide some initial conditions for doing an LSM run.  (Igor says that these
   were probably June conditions).  In general, LSM runs will require spin-ups,
   and these files just provide some consistent intial conditions for starting a run.

4. For giss_LSM (global off-line run with GISS ground hydrology)
In order to run the model offline globally, you must first locate
meteorological forcings files and specify their location in drv_gswp_force.f.
Of course, the forcing files needed will depend on the resolution that you
wish to run you model at.  Forcings files are available at 4x5 and 2x2.5
resolutions.  Currently, they are available at
/discover/nobackup/mjpuma/lsm_gswp (for 4x5) and
/discover/nobackup/mjpuma/lsm_gswp_2x2_5 (for 2x2.5)

a) Change directory in .modelErc for global parameters (depends on you settings
   in the run_name.mk file)
b) Adjust run_name.mk file to read in correct global parameters based on
   resolution of run
c) Set resolution of run by specifying im and jm in drv_gswp_force.f and
   lsm_standalone.f (only im = 72 and jm = 46; im = 144 and jm = 90)  
d) gmake setup RUN=run_name ESMF=YES (for runs on multiple processors)
e) Change to run directory and adjust run_name file to specify number of
   processors and number of nodes; np (number of processors) must also be specified) 


5. For coupled GCM run, HOW-TO forthcoming (ask Igor).
