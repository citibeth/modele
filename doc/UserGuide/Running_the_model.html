<H3>Running the model</H3>
<P>
The standard way to run modelE is to start it first from the initial
conditions, run it for one hour of model time, let it write the
checkpoint (restart) file and stop. After this one is supposed to check
the log file to make sure that the model behaves properly and then one 
can restart it for a longer run. While running, the model
periodically writes a checkpoint file, so that if it is stopped 
or killed by a system, it can be restarted from this checkpoint 
to continue the execution. Both ending times (for initial
short run and for a longer run) are specified in the rundeck in the
section with <code>INPUTZ</code> namelist parameters. The ending time
for a short run is specified on a line which starts with
<code>ISTART=</code>, the ending time for a longer run is specified on
the line above it. 

<P>
ModelE source repository provides a simple script for starting the
model runs: <code>modelE/exec/runE</code>. This script provides enough
functionality to run the model on personal computes (desktops and
laptops), but when working on a supercomputer one typically has to
submit the runs as batch jobs (since MPI jobs are not allowed to run
interactively). This functionality depends on a particular
architecture and a special script has to be written for each such
computer. You have to check local information for a particular
computer to see which scripts are available there.

<H4>Using <code>runE</code> script</H4>

<P>
The command to start a model run
<pre>
    runE &lt;RunID&gt; [-np NP] [-cold-restart] [-d] [-q] [-l logfile]
</pre>
Here <code>&lt;RunID&gt;</code> is the name of your run (rundeck name
without <code>.R</code>). The script accepts the following options:
<dl>
<dt><code>-np NP</code></dt>
<dd>
Run the model in parallel with <code>NP</code> MPI threads.
</dd>
<dt><code>-cold-restart</code></dt>
<dd>
Start the run from the initial conditions. If not specified the run
will be restarted from the latest checkpoint.
</dd>
<dt><code>-d</code></dt>
<dd>
Start the run in debugger. (You should compile the code with
<code>-g</code> flag). By default <code>gdb</code> is used starting
each MPI thread in a separate <code>xterm</code> window. If you want to use a
different debugger you can specify your own debugger command by
assigning it to an environment variable <code>DEBUG_COMMAND</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>-q</code></dt>
<dd>
Do not write output to the log file. By default all standard output is
written to <code>&lt;RunID&gt;.PRT</code> file.
</dd>
<dt><code>-l logfile</code></dt>
<dd>
Instead of <code>&lt;RunID&gt;.PRT</code> use <code>logfile</code> as
a log file.  
</dd>
</dl>

<P>
If you want to use this script to start model runs as batch jobs on a
supercomputer, you can do it in most cases. You just have to add a
variable <code>QSUB_STRING</code> to your <code>~/.modelErc</code>
file and set it to a command which would start an appropriate batch
job. Since typically one would need to change this command for
different types of jobs, it is advisable to use this method only for 
initial short runs.


<H4>Stopping the model</H4>

<P>
The standard way to stop the model is to use a command <code>sswE</code>
(also located in <code>modelE/exec</code>). To stop the run
<code>&lt;RunID&gt;</code> just execute the command
<pre>
    sswE &lt;RunID&gt;
</pre>
This will let the model know that you want to interrupt the
execution. The model will finish the current time step, write the
checkpoint file and then it will stop.
